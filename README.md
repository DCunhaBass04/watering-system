# watering-system
Project developed in a curricular context in order to meet the needed requisites (September 2023 - January 2024). 

This project is about managing a watering system. Here you can plan and schedule waterings, calculate the best path from X to Y using graphs and export the results.

Each functionality has its own documentation (see [docs](./sem3pi2023_24_g101/docs/)).

The UI is done in console.
